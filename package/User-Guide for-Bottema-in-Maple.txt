User Guide for BOTTEMA in Maple
                            
 
How to Install and Run BOTTEMA?
 
The BOTTEST is developed with the computer algebra system Maple, so without Maple you 
cannot use this program. Just place BOTTEMA under some subdirectory, say, X:\YY\ZZZ.
Then, in a Maple session, you can run this program, first, by reading BOTTEMA that is, type in
 
> read `X:/YY/ZZZ/BOTTEMA`;
 
 
be carefully the symbol ` ` cannot be omitted,  
and then you can use all the functions provided by BOTTEMA.

Commands and Examples on Inequality-type Theorem Proving.
 
prove
   Objective - prove a geometric inequality on a triangle or an equivalent algebraic inequality.
   Calling Sequence:
      prove(ineq);
      prove(ineq,[ineqs]); 
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an inequality to be proven, which is encoded in the geometric invariants listed 
              above.
      ineqs - a list of inequalities as the hypothesis, which is encoded as well in the geometric
              invariants listed above.
   Remark:
      - The command, prove, is valid to a geometric inequality on a triangle that must be of type
        <= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an open
        set with the whole/partial boundary; ineq and ineqs must be represented by the rational 
        functions and radicals in the geometric invariants listed above.
      - The command, prove, is also valid to a statement whose hypothesis and thesis, ineqs and 
        ineq, all are homogeneous algebraic inequalities represented by the rational functions and 
        radicals in x, y, z provided x>0, y>0, z>0, and of the required types as above. This is 
        equivalent to a geometric one.
   Examples:
      > prove( a^2+b^2+c^2 >= 4*sqrt(3)*S+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2+(a-b)^2 );
      > prove( A >= B,[ a >= b ] );
xprove
   Objective - prove an algebraic inequality with positive variables.
   Calling Sequence:
      xprove(ineq);
      xprove(ineq,[ineqs]);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an algebraic inequality to be proven, with positive variables.
      ineqs - a list of algebraic inequalities as the hypothesis, with positive variables.
   Remark:
      - The command, xprove, is valid to an algebraic inequality, ineq, which must be of type
        <= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an
        open set or an open set with the whole/partial boundary.
      - All the hypothesis and thesis must be represented by the rational functions and radicals.
      - All the variables appear in ineq and ineqs are supposed always positive that conditions
        need not be explicitly included.
   Examples:
      > xprove( sqrt(u^2+v^2)+sqrt((1-u)^2+(1-v)^2) >= sqrt(2),[ u <= 1,v <= 1 ] );
      > xprove( (x+1)^(1/3)+sqrt(y-1)+x*y+1/x+1/y^2 >= 42496/10000,[ y > 1 ] );
      > xprove( (x+1)^(1/3)+sqrt(y-1)+x*y+1/x+1/y^2 >= 42497/10000,[ y > 1 ] );
yprove

        open set or an open set with the whole/partial boundary.
      - All the hypothesis and thesis must be represented by the rational functions and radicals.
   Examples:
      > f:=x^6*y^6+6*x^6*y^5-6*x^5*y^6+15*x^6*y^4-36*x^5*y^5+15*x^4*y^6
           +20*x^6*y^3-90*x^5*y^4+90*x^4*y^5-20*x^3*y^6+15*x^6*y^2
           -120*x^5*y^3+225*x^4*y^4-120*x^3*y^5+15*x^2*y^6+6*x^6*y
           -90*x^5*y^2+300*x^4*y^3-300*x^3*y^4+90*x^2*y^5-6*x*y^6+x^6

           -90*x*y^2+20*y^3+16*x^2-36*x*y+16*y^2-6*x+6*y+1:
      > yprove(f>=0);
 
 
Remark on the inequality-type theorems belonging to the so-called CGR class.
It is not necessary to use CGR for inequality proving, but that makes the proving rapidly for a theorem
belonging to the so-called CGR class.
If you don¡¯t know anything about the CGR class, please refer to the last references in the
references part. In this program, we have a global variable CGR, whose default value is zero.
It means that the inequality-type theorem to be handled does not necessarily belong to CGR class. 
If it is sure that the theorem definitely belongs to CGR class, we can assign 1 to variable CGR,
That is, type in
 
>CGR:=1; 
 
and then, afterwards in this Maple session, the program will regard every inequality to be proven 
as one belonging to CGR class, unless the user assigns 0 to variable CGR, that is, type in
 
>CGR:=0;
 
 
Commands and Examples on Global Optimization.
cmin
   Objective - find the best possible minimal constant, var, such that the inequality 
               system holds.
   Calling Sequence:
      cmin(ineq,[ineqs],var);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an inequality to be proven, which is encoded in the geometric invariants listed 
              above and contains the variable, var.
      ineqs - a list of inequalities as the hypothesis, which is encoded as well in the geometric
              invariants listed above and doesn't contain the variable, var.
   Remark:
      - The command, cmin, is valid to a geometric inequality on a triangle that must be of type
        <= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an open
        set with the whole/partial boundary; ineq and ineqs must be represented by the rational 
        functions and radicals in the geometric invariants listed above.
      - The command, cmin, is also valid to a statement whose hypothesis and thesis, ineqs and 
        ineq, all are homogeneous algebraic inequalities represented by the rational functions 
        and radicals in x, y, z provided x>0, y>0, z>0, and of the required types as above. This 
        is equivalent to a geometric one.
   Examples:
      > cmin( wa^2+wb^2+wc^2 <= 4*R^2+11*r^2+k*r*(R-2*r),[],k );
ccmin
   This command has the same function and usage as that of cmin, but it assumes the best possible 
   minimal constant will be got at the isosceles triangle case.
   Examples:
      > ccmin( wa^2+wb^2+wc^2 <= 4*R^2+11*r^2+k*r*(R-2*r),[],k );
findmin
   Objective - find the best possible minimal constant, var, such that the inequality system holds.
   Calling Sequence:
      findmin(var,ineq,[ineqs]);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an inequality to be proven, which is encoded in the geometric invariants listed above
              and contains the variable, var.
      ineqs - a list of inequalities as the hypothesis, which is encoded as well in the geometric
              invariants listed above and doesn't contain the variable, var.
   Remark:
      - The command, findmin, is valid to a geometric inequality on a triangle that must be of type
        <= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an open
        set with the whole/partial boundary; ineq and ineqs must be represented by the rational 
        functions and radicals in the geometric invariants listed above.
      - The command, findmin, is also valid to a statement whose hypothesis and thesis, ineqs and ineq,
        all are homogeneous algebraic inequalities represented by the rational functions and radicals
        in x, y, z provided x>0, y>0, z>0, and of the required types as above. This is equivalent to
        a geometric one.
      - The command, findmin, has the same function as that of cmin and ccmin except that it will decide
        if cmin or ccmin can be used automatically.
   Examples:
      > findmin( k,wa^2+wb^2+wc^2 <= 4*R^2+11*r^2+k*r*(R-2*r),[] );
fmin
   Objective - find the best possible minimal constant, var, such that the inequality system holds.
               But this time we get an approximation value, not an accurate value.
   Calling Sequence:
      fmin(ineq,start,end,dig,var,[ineqs]);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an inequality to be proven, which is encoded in the geometric invariants listed above
              and contains the variable, var.
      ineqs - a list of inequalities as the hypothesis, which is encoded as well in the geometric
              invariants listed above and doesn't contain the variable, var.
      start - assume var>start.
      end   - assume var<= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an open
        set with the whole/partial boundary; ineq and ineqs must be represented by the rational 
        functions and radicals in the geometric invariants listed above.
      - The command, fmin, is also valid to a statement whose hypothesis and thesis, ineqs and ineq,
        all are homogeneous algebraic inequalities represented by the rational functions and radicals
        in x, y, z provided x>0, y>0, z>0, and of the required types as above. This is equivalent to
        a geometric one.
      - The command, fmin, saves the result, u and v, into a file named result. We get var belongs to
        the interval [u,v].
   Examples:
      > fmin( wa^2+wb^2+wc^2 <= 4*R^2+11*r^2+k*r*(R-2*r),-10,10,5,k,[] );
      > read result;
xmin
   Objective - find the best possible minimal constant, var, such that the inequality system holds.
   Calling Sequence:
      xmin(ineq,[ineqs],var);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an algebraic inequality to be proven, with positive variables and variable, var.
      ineqs - a list of algebraic inequalities as the hypothesis, with positive variables and without
              variable, var.
   Remark:
      - The command, xmin, is valid to an algebraic inequality, ineq, which must be of type
        <= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an
        open set or an open set with the whole/partial boundary.
      - All the hypothesis and thesis must be represented by the rational functions and radicals.
      - All the variables appear in ineq and ineqs are supposed always positive that conditions
        need not be explicitly included.
   Examples:
      > read bottema;  (or, say, > read `bottema.dat`;)
      > ineq:=1/5*(x2^3+1)^(1/3)*x2^2*x3^2<=k;
      > ineqs:=x2^3+1 <= 12167/1000,
               x3 <= 32/10,
               10-(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-x2^2-x3^2-2/5*x2*x3 >= 0,
               sqrt(250-25*(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-25*x2^2-25*x3^2+10*x2*x3)
               +sqrt(250-25*(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-25*x2^2-25*x3^2-10*x2*x3) <= 32;
      > xmin(ineq,[ineqs],k);
 
xfmin
   Objective - find the best possible minimal constant, var, such that the inequality system holds.
               But this time we get an approximation value, not an accurate value.
   Calling Sequence:
      xfmin(ineq,start,end,dig,var,[ineqs]);
   Parameters:
      ineq  - an algebraic inequality to be proven, with positive variables and variable, var.
      ineqs - a list of algebraic inequalities as the hypothesis, with positive variables and without
              variable, var.
      start - assume var>start.
      end   - assume var<= or >=, with a set of inequalities, ineqs, as the hypothesis which defines either an
        open set or an open set with the whole/partial boundary.
      - All the hypothesis and thesis must be represented by the rational functions and radicals.
      - All the variables appear in ineq and ineqs are supposed always positive that conditions
        need not be explicitly included.
      - The command, xfmin, saves the result, u and v, into a file named result. We get var belongs to
        the interval [u,v].
   Examples:
      > ineq:=1/5*(x2^3+1)^(1/3)*x2^2*x3^2<=k;
      > ineqs:=x2^3+1 <= 12167/1000,
               x3 <= 32/10,
               10-(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-x2^2-x3^2-2/5*x2*x3 >= 0,
               sqrt(250-25*(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-25*x2^2-25*x3^2+10*x2*x3)
               +sqrt(250-25*(x2^3+1)^(2/3)-25*x2^2-25*x3^2-10*x2*x3) <= 32;
      > xfmin(ineq,0,40,5,k,[ineqs]);
      > read result;
      
As for the best possible maximal constant, we have commands, cmax, ccmax, findmax, fmax, xmax and
xfmax. The usage of them is similar to that of cmin, ccmin, findmin, fmin,xmin and xfmin.
